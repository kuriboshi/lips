\subsection{Properties}
This section describes some properties that are used internally by the
shell.

\begin{description}
\item[alias] this is used during alias expansion.  Let's say we want
  to define an alias for ls that uses the -F option of ls: \lisp{(putprop 'l
  'alias '(ls -F))}.  To simplify defining aliases the lisp function
  alias is provided (see below).
\item[autoload] If during evaluation of a form, an undefined function
  is found the offending atom may have a file stored under this
  property. If this is the case the file is loaded and evaluation is
  allowed to continue.  If the function is still undefined error
  processing takes over.
\end{description}
