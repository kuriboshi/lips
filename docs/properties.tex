\subsection{Properties}
This section describes some properties that are used internally by the
shell.

\begin{description}
\item[alias] this is used during alias expansion.  Let's say we want
  to define an alias for ls that uses the -F option of ls: \lisp{(putprop 'l
  'alias '(ls -F))}.  To simplify defining aliases the lisp function
  alias is provided (see below).
\item[autoload] If during evaluation of a form, an undefined function
  is found the offending atom may have a file stored under this
  property. If this is the case the file is loaded and evaluation is
  allowed to continue.  If the function is still undefined error
  processing takes over.
