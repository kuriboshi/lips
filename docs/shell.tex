\section{\lips\ as a Shell}
If a function is \lisp{unbound} the \lips\ shell tries to run the
function as an executable.  When \lips\ reads an expression some
characters are treated as read-macros.  A read-macro can expand or
transform the input in different ways.  The current version of the
reader in \lips\ isn't fully developed yet and it's likely to be
improved in later versions.

In addition to read-macros the input is also transformed using a hook
which is evaluated after an expression is read and before it's
evaluated.  For example, the input \lisp{ls | wc -l} is rewritten by
the transform hook into \lisp{(pipe-cmd (ls) (wc -l))}.  The
\lisp{pipe-cmd} function evaluates each expression in a separate
process, connecting the stdout from the \lisp{ls} function (i.e. the
\lisp{ls} command) to the stdin of the \lisp{wc} function (command).

Redirection of stdout and stdin is also handled by the transform hook.
