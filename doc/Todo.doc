_M_o_r_e _I_m_p_o_r_t_a_n_t

  *  Append to last atom after history substituition.

  *  Make sure all local lisp variables are  protected  from
     gc.

  *  Interrupt is not reliable.  Commands inside lisp  loops
     can't be interrupted.

  *  Escaping is hardly useful in its present form.   It  is
     only  possible  to  avoid read macro interpretaion with
     it.

  *  It isn't possible to put funny characters on  the  com-
     mand line.

  *  EXPAND includes .  and  ..  in  the  expansion.   These
     should be included only if requested.

  *  The functions CHDIR and CD should  parse  the  new  cwd
     instead of using _g_e_t_w_d().

  *  Globbing can't handle ranges.

  *  The posibility to collect  output  from  commands,  the
     backquote facility of /_b_i_n/_s_h.

  *  Floating point numbers should be  a  run  time  option.
     They  are  most  likely more seldom used than filenames
     looking like floats.

  *  Catch all failing system calls and report  with  proper
     error message.

  *  If _e_x_e_c_v_e() fails with a NOEXEC error, try /_b_i_n/_s_h.

  *  Switches that look like integers should be  treated  as
     switches.  Unary plus is forbidden and negative numbers
     are converted to -n.

_L_e_s_s _I_m_p_o_r_t_a_n_t

  *  Arrays.

                           - 2 -


  *  Some way  to  turn  the  end  of  file  character  off.
     Perhaps by a hook that is run at the end of file condi-
     tion.  Default would be exit.

  *  A set of functions manipulating the stack.

  *  User read macros.

  *  Real command hashtables.

  *  Emacs style line editing.

  *  Errors in subshells are  not  handled  very  well.   It
     would  be  nice  if  the failing process could tell the
     main _l_i_p_s process that it failed and let the main  pro-
     cess talk to the user.
